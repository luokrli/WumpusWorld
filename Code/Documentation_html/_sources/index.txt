Project Introduction
---------------------
This project was built for the engineering design problem of Problem Set 2. Its requirements were to design a simulation of the game Wumpus World and create an artificially intelligent agent to interact in the simulation (known as a cave). The simulation consists of a pile of gold and a wumpus monster both randomly and uniformly located in one of the rooms of the simulation. Pits are randomly located throughout the rooms as well with a probability of a .2 chance being in a room. The agents goal is to find the gold, pick it up, and climb out of the cave safely with it. If the agent encounters a room with the wumpus or a pit, it dies. The agent is given one arrow to kill the wumpus if needed. Performance measures include: +1000 for leaving with gold, -1000 for dying, -10 for using arrow, -1 for each move processed.
