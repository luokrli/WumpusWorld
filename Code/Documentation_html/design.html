<h2>How it Works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This Wumpus World Simulation has two implementations. It is either run with a GUI via Tkinter interface or run without one
with a representation printed to stdout.  In both versions, the underlying simulation is run the same. Only the representation
of the current state and results is displayed differently.</p>
<p>The Exterior:</p>
<p>GUI - When the command &#8220;python wwsim.py -gui&#8221; is run, a window is displayed with a representation of the Wumpus World and current
states displayed on the side. Percepts are listed under the board. The user can see the locations of all of the items in this new
simulation but the agent cannot. With each click of the button the agent calculates and performs a move. Its performance score is
kept in the upper right corner of the window. The user can choose to reset the simulation at any time, however, this will create
a new simulation each time. When the game ends, the &#8220;Move&#8221; button disappears and the user is only left with the option to reset.</p>
<p>Non-GUI - When the command &#8220;python wwagent.py -nongui&#8221; is run, the program loops through an entire game of agent moves and prints
out a representation of each move to stdout. Each move is printed along with the agent&#8217;s location, performance, orientation,
arrow-status, percepts, gold-status, the wumpus-location, pit locations, and the gold location. To run a new simulation you must
call the command again.</p>
<p>The Interior:</p>
<p>When a simulation is created, it sets all game states to their starting value and creates a new game scenario by randomly assigning
locations to the items of the world (wumpus, pits, gold, and agent). Whenever a move is made, a method in the driver part of the
program updates the agent with the current percepts and asks for an action. Based upon this action, the simulation updates its
states and, if the agents moves locations, provides the new percepts. The update function for the simulation is basically a list of
conditions depending on the given action. For example, if the action is &#8216;shoot&#8217; it will decrement the agent an arrow.
If the action is &#8216;move&#8217; it will check to make sure the agent can move the direction it is facing otherwise it will produce a &#8216;bump&#8217;
percept. The simulation is the foundation of the program because it creates the whole game, updates its states, and checks to see if the game is over.</p>
<p>The agent class only has to operate providing an action from the agent for the simulation given a set of percepts. The agent however is
artificially intelligent so it has a knowledge base for storing memory of information about its past locations and uses logic to make
inferences based upon this information. Therefore its main function is action(). This method works by first updating the agent&#8217;s stats
based upon its previous action. Then, if it has not previously visited its current location, it will tell its knowledge base the current
percepts. Next it updates its understanding of safe spaces and dangerous spaces in the world. The agent asks its knowledge base about the
spaces adjacent to its location that it has not visited. If the knowledge base determines a space is safe or dangerous, the agent will add
it to either its lists of safe/dangerous spaces respectively. Otherwise it will add it to its unsure list. The agent uses this information
determinding a goal to create a planned path towards. It first checks the safe list, then the unsure list, and then the dangerous list. The
create a plan method is given a location from one of these lists and develops a list of actions to get to that goal.</p>
<p>The agent now makes a decision on an action to return. For example, if there is a &#8216;glitter&#8217; in its current location and it does not have the gold yet, the
action is &#8216;grab&#8217;. If the decision comes down to an action from the agent&#8217;s plan and it has no plan it will create one. Otherwise it will return the next
action in its plan. Once the action is determined and return (to the simulation) the game moves on.</p>
<p>The simulation has a terminal_test method that returns whether the game has ended. It will return true if either the agent climbs out of the
cave, or if it dies.</p>

<h2>Design Choices<a class="headerlink" href="#design-choices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Designing the simulation was a straight-forward process. It just had to meet the requirements of the Wumpus World simulation. For the visual</dt>
<dd>aspect of the sim, I used Tkinter and images built in paint to represent the Wumpus World environment and simulation states. In the main
implementation of the game, only two buttons are available: &#8220;Move&#8221; and &#8220;Reset&#8221;. When the game ends, the &#8220;Move&#8221; button is hidden forcing the
user to reset the simulation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The major design choices came with the development of the agent. I based my implementation off of a pseudo algorithm similar to the hybrid agent
from the book. The most difficult part of the project for me was creating the knowledge base. I looked at the code from the book for inspiration but ended up
creating my own class for it. I did however use the expr() method from the logic.py file for storing my logic sentences. The knowledge base I created is
specific to the Wumpus World so when instantiated, it has knowledge of all of the specific rules of that environment. The second most difficult part of the project
was the design of my agent&#8217;s create a plan method. The agent takes in its percepts and adds what it learns to its knowledge. Then it categorizes neighboring rooms
as either safe, not safe, or unsure. When picking a next goal, I make sure that the agent only picks from safe rooms or unsure rooms if no safe rooms are available.
If the only rooms left to explore are not safe, the agent will just leave the cave. These qualities make my agent&#8217;s risk level very moderate. It takes risks when
making decisions with unsure rooms, but it will leave if it thinks there is no possibility to get the gold.</p>
<p>Once I had the agent&#8217;s movement under consistent control, I went ahead and added some features for the arrow. When the simulation starts, the agent
is facing right and its first move is to &#8220;move&#8221;. I added a feature however where if the agent notices a stench in the starting room, its first
move is to &#8220;shoot&#8221;. I did this because the agent starts in a corner so the wumpus has a 50% chance of being in the room to the right. Whether the
wumpus is in that room or not, the agent now knows that that room is safe (from the wumpus) to travel in. The next feature I added was based on an
observation I made watching my agent perform numerous times. The most times the wumpus would eat him were when the agent was unsure about the rooms safety
but made it a goal nonetheless. Now when the agent is headed for an unsure room, if it senses a stench just before its final move into the room, it shoots an arrow.
Whether the wumpus is in that room or not it increases the rooms probability of being safe.</p>
