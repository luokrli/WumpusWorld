# Wumpus World

This is the final project for CISC6525 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2020.

The wwagent.py is for the agent. Please read the comments for detailed algorithms.

Please run the wwsim.py in shell (`python -i wwsim.py -gui`) to simulate the Wumpus World with GUI. Read the code for detailed commands to configure the GUI/Non-GUI options.

The code was modified from the random agent provided by the CISC6525 class (wwagent_random.py in ./Code/drafts) and [Greg Scottâ€™s Wumpus World Project](https://github.com/gregscott94/wumpus-world).
